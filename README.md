# CSCI-3308-Project

## Crime Avoidance Map: Denver

Justin Teufel, Levi Nickerson, and Steve Su 

### Vision Statement

The product we are releasing is software that reads publicly available crime data from the city of Denver and creates an interactive visualization. The visualiaztion/map allows the user to input an address or route and evaluate the crime statistics to determine if the area or the route is dangerous. Potential uses for this product include:
  - A user is moving to a new address and wishes to quickly pull crime statistics for various streets.
  - A user is walking home late at night and wants to see if the route he's taking is potentially dangerous. 

### Motivation

We are working on this project because it is an interesing idea that incorporates a lot of challenges. The potential challenges we may face are:
  - Pulling the data from the sorce and manipulating it in a way that can be used for the visualization.
  - How do we store the data once we have edited it? How do we create a database that is easily accessible? 
  - How do we get our product to the user? Is it web based? Is there a mobile app?
  - How do we create a design that is easily understandable and usable? 
All of these problems will produce a well rounded project that will give us the opportunity to venture into various different fields. 

### Risks to Project Completion 
  - Working remote with team members 
  - Scheduling Conflicts 
  - Varying levels of expertise (we are going to have to step out of our comfort zone for certain tasks) 
  
### Mitigation Strategy
  - Proper Communication will solve the majority of conflicts
  - Setting Milestones that are reasonable and clearly established
  - Be consistent with meetings 
  
### Development Stategy 
We have decided to utilize a scrum development strategy. We plan on having scrums that last two weeks. We plan on meeting weekly because it seems impracticle to have daily scrum meetings. However, we will send out email updates at least two times a week to inform the team about current progress. 

### Project Tracking Software
We are going to use Trello to track our project progress.
